Event Management System
1 week twitter developer challenge;

This project is a web application using MEN Stack with a pint of Vue. 
The system models and specification designs are in the /models folder.
Users can login, add and manage events or tasks.

The system should evolve as users prefer mobile applications to web apps in this need space. 

Implementation roadmap and local run instructions will be added soon.
